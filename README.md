### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ali,

I work as a Freelance Front-End Developer, helping companies ceating nice applications for humans. I enjoy gathering new impressions, views, and insights, harmonizing them with my experiences and create something new out of these - accordingly I bring along an open mindset as well as a high degree of critical ability and discussion culture.

Over the last few years I've been focusing more and more on the Vue environment, and it so happens that I'm currently working on a project based on Vue 3 as well.
